  <!-- <h1>Subtitle</h1> -->
  <p>As a long-time magnet for coastal development, South Florida has experienced explosive population growth in the last few decades. The desire of many residents to live along the coast exposes them to the direct impacts of ocean waves, storm surge, tidal inundation, beach erosion, and sea-level rise. Recent impacts of hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, which have caused loss of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars in losses in the US and the Caribbean, have highlighted the crucial need to explore effective and cost-efficient methods to decrease such threats.</p>

  <p>Given these conditions, protecting residents and the local economy has taken center stage in the social, cultural, and political life of Florida. The University of Miami is uniquely qualified and strategically located to take a leading role in developing science-based strategies to enhance the resilience of our high-value but vulnerable coastline.</p>

  <p class="center-title">Damage from Waves</p>
</div>
<div class="main-text">
  <p><strong>Wave damage to coasts and coastal property</strong>:</p>
  <p>Ocean waves can cover a wide range of scales, from the smallest ripples generated as the wind starts to blow to ocean scale motions generated by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun (tides) and still further to tectonic motions (tsunamis).</p>
  <br>

  <p>What are <strong>wind-generated waves</strong>?</p>
  <p>As wind blows across a body of water like the ocean, the water at the sea surface interface begins to move in the same direction. If the body of water is large and the wind moves over long distances, the surface waters form waves. This process is called <strong>wind forcing</strong>, and the distance of water over which this process occurs is called <strong>fetch</strong>.</p>
  <p>For wind-generated waves, the strength, direction, and duration of the wind forcing all contribute to a wave’s energy and its potential to cause damage onshore, making it very important to give due attention to such waves when planning coastal protection strategies. An extreme example of these damaging conditions can be found in the massive waves from hurricanes making landfall. </p>

  <p>When ocean waves enter the surf zone (the area close to shore where waves break), they become taller until they lose stability and break, releasing the energy built up by the wind forcing. The energy contained within a wave is converted to nearshore currents, water level set-up, and turbulence, all of which can cause structural damage and/or increase erosion, or scour at the base of seawalls, roadbeds, and bridges.</p>

  <p>Should the waves strike a structure during the breaking process, the <strong>load</strong> (amount of physical force) on that structure is dramatically higher than in the absence of a wave. If high energy waves strike a coastal structure repeatedly, that structure’s integrity can become fatigued or even fail. The <strong>set-up</strong> of the water level (increase in water height as a wave flows up a shoreline slope) and direct wave action can also cause overtopping of structures, which in turn can lead to flooding or building and infrastructure damage. </p>

  <p>All of these wave-related factors can occur in combination during severe storms, leading to significant damage to coasts and coastal property.</p>

  <p>For issues related to coastal resilience, it is typically wind-generated waves that are the most important to consider, with their potential for causing damage being closely related to the strength, direction, and duration of the wind forcing. An extreme example of these damaging conditions can be found in landfalling hurricanes.</p>

  <p>When ocean waves enter the surf zone they increase in height until they become unstable and break, releasing the energy built up by the wind forcing. The energy contained within a wave is proportional to the square of the wave height and, in the process of breaking, this energy is converted to nearshore currents , water level set-up , and turbulence, all of which can cause structural damage and/or increase erosion such as  scour at the base of seawalls, roadbeds, and bridges.</p>

  <p>Should the waves strike a structure during the breaking process, the load on that structure is dramatically higher than in the absence of a wave. The repeated striking of high energy waves on coastal structures can cause structural fatigue and failure. The set-up of the water level and direct wave action can also cause overtopping of structures, which in turn can lead to flooding or damage to buildings and other infrastructure that are not protected against submersion.</p>

  <p>All of these wave related factors can occur in combination during severe storms, leading to significant damage to coasts and coastal property.</p> -->
